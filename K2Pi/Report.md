# K2pi

## Introduction

This is the report for the K2pi assignement for the Datenanalyse project.
In this report we will document our results and how we got to said results.

The project is a collaboration effort between Nora Salgo, Tino Heuberger, Manuel Sommerhalder, Stefan Hochi and Anar Bold

### The experiment

The experiment, which is called K2Pi, analyses the decay of a K<sup>+</sup> particle into a π<sup>0</sup> and a π<sup>+</sup>
Where the lifetime of a kaon can be determined by analasying the data from anohter experiment called LifeK.

As we can see, we have a collimator which generates a stream of Kaon particles. Then we have two detectors placed at a certain distance from each other along the flight path of the kaon. The first detector is called the "Up stream detectors" and measures how many Kaons are in the stream, where the second detector, called "Downstream detector", measures the decayed pions.

However the pions also have a decay time which is given by T<sub>π</sub> = 2.6 * 10<sup>-8</sup>s, which gives us an average travel distance of Beta\*Gamma\*c\*T<sub>π</sub> = 4.188km before a pion decays.
